Predicting Bike Rentals with Machine Learning
This project is part of the DataQuest coursework. It focuses on using machine learning to help predict output, specifically with bike rental data. D.C. collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day. Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto compiled this data into a csv. The file contains 17380 rows, which represent the number of bike rentals for a given hour of a given day.
